<!-- ### The approach taken (learned)
- I decided to go with 4 models initially which were users, posts, likes, and relationships(users follow other users ). However, I completely got stuck with relationship model following the tutorials and decided to cut off likes model to make it deadline. The feature seems quite simple but it took me a while to figure it out and finally made it work at the end. -->


### Wanted features
- Likes model
- resposive
- footer
- header
- clean up messy code
- so much more!
