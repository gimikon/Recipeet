### How to use
You can post your food pictures that you made, cooked, and ate at restaurant! People can follow you and look at your feed you posted !


### Technology  
HTML,CSS,Ruby, Ruby on rails

### The approach taken (learned)
- I decided to go with 4 models initially which were users, posts, likes, and followers. However, after I finished users and posts that are reasonably straightforward. I completely got stuck with users follower model following the tutorials. The feature seems quite simple but it took me a while to figure it out and finally made it work at the end.


### Wanted features
- Likes
- resposive
- footer
- header
- clean up messy code
